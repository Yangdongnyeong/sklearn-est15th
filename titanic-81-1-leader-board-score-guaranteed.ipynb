    "Hello Fellow Kagglers,I decided to write this kernel because **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is one of the Well-Known competition on Kaggle. This is a beginner level kernel which tests your **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering** skills. Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. At first this kernel would look Quite large , but if u stick to it to it , to the very end u will truly learn a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a great competition to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering** from other kernels available here , that can help Improve the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have any idea that might improve this kernel, please be sure to comment, or fork and experiment as you like.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I have researched and learned a lot from other kernels to provide better results. I just want to **`Thank`** the kaggle community for being so generous.    "

    "The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.\n",

    "I have tried my best to explain every complex code written and even given links in between for Reference.\n",

To conclude, cabins used by 1st class passengers have higher survival rates than cabins used by 2nd and 3rd class passengers.

It is a unique group with shared characteristics. `Deck` feature has high-cardinality right now so some of the values are grouped with each other based on their similarities.\n",

    "The first thing to note is that only the numeric features are compared as it is obvious that we cannot correlate between alphabets or strings. Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**POSITIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated**. A value **1 means perfect positive correlation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEGATIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated**. A value **-1 means perfect negative correlation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as **MultiColinearity** as both of them contains almost the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "So do you think we should use both of them as **one of them is redundant**. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated. The highest correlation is between **SibSp and Parch i.e 0.37**. So we can carry on with all features."

    "`Age` and `Fare` features are binned. Binning helped dealing with outliers and it revealed some homogeneous groups in those features. `Family_Size` is created by adding `Parch` and `SibSp` features and **1**. `Ticket_Frequency` is created by counting the occurence of `Ticket` values.\n",

    "`Name` feature is very useful. First, `Title` and `Is_Married` features are created from the title prefix in the names. Second, `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Family_Survival_Rate_NA`  features are created by target encoding the surname of the passengers. `Ticket_Survival_Rate` is created by target encoding the `Ticket` feature. `Survival_Rate` feature is created by averaging the `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Ticket_Survival_Rate` features.\n",

    "Finally, the non-numeric type features are label encoded and categorical features are one-hot encoded. Created **5** new features (`Family_Size`, `Title`, `Is_Married`, `Survival_Rate` and `Survival_Rate_NA`) and dropped the useless features after encoding."
